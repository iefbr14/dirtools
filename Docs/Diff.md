# Diff
Since all of the tools are simple perl script, it is easy to make local
modifications/bug fixes to the installed versions.  Make diff is used to check 
to see what has changed relative to the current git repository.

> make diff-home
> make diff-local
> make diff-os

If you see no changes relative to installed version it would then be safe
to install a new version.
